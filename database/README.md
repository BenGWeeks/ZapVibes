# Database Deployment

1. Ensure you have SQLite installed on your machine.
2. Run the `create.sql` script to create the database and tables.
3. Update the `.env` file with the correct connection details.
4. Use a SQLite viewer (like the SQLite extension in VSCode) to view the tables and their data.
