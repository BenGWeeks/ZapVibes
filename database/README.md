# Database Deployment

1. Ensure you have SQLite installed on your machine.
2. Run the `create.sql` script using a SQLite command line tool or a SQLite GUI tool to create the database and tables.
3. The location of the database file is specified in the `.env` file in the `DATABASE_URL` variable.
4. To view the database in VS Code, install the "SQLite" extension. Open the command palette (Ctrl+Shift+P), type "SQLite: Open Database", and navigate to your .db file.
